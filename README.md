# Flutter UI Design
This design is inspired by https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/app-design-inspiration-month1 (1st UI Screen in heading: '2. Student Profiles')
This is my first UI design of a page in Flutter.
All the code has been done in main.dart file. Any comments on the way I code/ best practises for coding would be very much appreciated
